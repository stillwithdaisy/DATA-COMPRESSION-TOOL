## Basic Data Compression Using Run-Length Encoding (RLE)
This project focuses on the implementation of a basic data compression algorithm known as Run-Length Encoding (RLE). The main objective of the project is to demonstrate how simple yet effective compression techniques can be applied to reduce the size of data by encoding repeating elements efficiently. The project was developed using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as the integrated development environment (IDE), and the programming logic was explored in both VB.NET and Lua for versatility and platform demonstration.

Run-length encoding is one of the simplest forms of lossless data compression techniques. It is most effective for data sets that contain many consecutive repeating characters or elements. The principle behind RLE is straightforward: it replaces sequences of the same data value occurring in many consecutive data elements with a single value and a count. For example, the string "aaabbcccc" would be encoded as "3a2b4c", indicating three 'a's, two 'b's, and four 'c's. This approach significantly reduces the storage space required for such repetitive data.

The development environment used was Visual Studio Code, a lightweight but powerful source code editor available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. It supports many programming languages and includes features such as debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, and Git integration. The code for this project was implemented and tested using two scripting languages: VB.NET, a modern object-oriented language developed by Microsoft, and Lua, a lightweight and fast scripting language often used in embedded systems and game development. Using both languages in the same development environment demonstrates the flexibility of VS Code in handling multiple languages and builds.

In VB.NET, the RLE logic was implemented using loops and string manipulation functions, making use of the .NET framework's rich library support. The Lua implementation showcased the algorithm's logic in a compact and efficient manner, utilizing Lua's powerful string handling capabilities. Both versions produced the same output and followed the same encoding principle, proving the algorithm's adaptability across languages.

The application of this project can be extended to compress simple text data, image pixel patterns (especially in formats like BMP or TGA), and any type of input where repetition of characters or bytes is common. RLE is particularly beneficial in situations where system memory and storage capacity are limited, such as in embedded systems, sensor data logging, or text-based communication protocols.

By working on this project, I gained a deeper understanding of data compression techniques, language-specific string handling, and cross-language development. Additionally, the use of Visual Studio Code streamlined the development process, enabling quick testing, debugging, and comparison between implementations in different languages. This project serves as a practical example of how foundational computer science concepts like compression can be implemented with minimal resources while delivering impactful results in data storage and transmission.

In conclusion, this project not only demonstrates a fundamental compression technique but also highlights the practical advantages of working in a multi-language development environment like Visual Studio Code, showing that even basic algorithms can be crucial in optimizing performance and efficiency in computing applications.
